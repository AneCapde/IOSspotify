# IOSspotify
Our app consists of an offline music player that is similar to Spotify but lacks online functionality. Because the songs are stored on the phone, no internet connection is required.
The following are some of our application's key features:
- Songs can be added or removed from playlists.
- Search function: There is a search bar that allows us to filter songs based on their titles. In addition, the songs will be listed alphabetically.
- The Player's basic functions are as follows: pause the music, play, next song, previous song, and a bar that allows us to see the song's progress. The player can be expanded and shrunk.
It is important to note that the information for the songs is derived from the metadata of the mp3 files. Metadata is critical because it aids in the organization of information.
Finally, we've added login and registration functionality. Furthermore, when the app is closed, the last song listened to by each user is saved and will appear when the app is restarted.
